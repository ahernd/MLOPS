# End-to-End Machine Learning Workflow

## 1. Data Preprocessing
- Dataset: California Housing Dataset
- Steps: Scaling, Feature Engineering

## 2. Model Selection and Tuning
- Models: Random Forest, XGBoost
- Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV

## 3. Explainable AI (XAI)
- Used SHAP for interpreting model predictions.

## 4. Deployment
- Deployed Streamlit app on AWS EC2 using Docker.

## Challenges
- Encountered issues with Docker networking, resolved by setting correct EC2 security groups.
